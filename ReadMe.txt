Following the hint from the code, I have implemented supportive 2 data structures:
    1. A directed graph with weighted edges;
    2. An Index Minimum Heap.
    
Based on these 2 supporting data structures, I have implemented the Dijkstra algorithm to find out the road.

Everything worked correctly.
